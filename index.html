                        <strong>A comprehensive and up-to-date textbook and reference for computational
                            imaging.</strong><br><br>

                        Computational imaging involves the joint design of imaging hardware and computer algorithms to
                        create novel imaging systems with unprecedented capabilities. In recent years such capabilities
                        include cameras that operate at a trillion frames per second, microscopes that can see small
                        viruses
                        long thought to be optically irresolvable, and telescopes that capture images of black holes.
                        This
                        text offers a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to this rapidly growing field, a
                        convergence
                        of vision, graphics, signal processing, and optics. It can be used as an instructional resource
                        for
                        computer imaging courses and as a reference for professionals. It covers the fundamentals of the
                        field, current research and applications, and light transport techniques.
                        <br><br>
                        The text first presents an imaging toolkit, including optics, image sensors, and illumination,
                        and a
                        computational toolkit, introducing modeling, mathematical tools, model-based inversion,
                        data-driven
                        inversion techniques, and hybrid inversion techniques. It then examines different modalities of
                        light, focusing on the plenoptic function, which describes degrees of freedom of a light ray.
                        Finally, the text outlines light transport techniques, describing imaging systems that obtain
                        micron-scale 3D shape or optimize for noise-free imaging, optical computing, and
                        non-line-of-sight
                        imaging. Throughout, it discusses the use of computational imaging methods in a range of
                        application
                        areas, including smart phone photography, autonomous driving, and medical imaging.
                        End-of-chapter
                        exercises help put the material in context.
